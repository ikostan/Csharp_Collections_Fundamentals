# C# Collections Fundamentals

## Description:<br/>
This course aims to empower you to take advantage of the surprisingly rich set of collections that are available in C#. 
You'll learn how to use the various collection types to store data as arrays, lists, dictionaries, linked lists, or sets, 
as well as how to customize collection behavior in C#. You'll also learn how many of these types work under the hood 
and the implications for performance. This course also covers enumerators and the collection interfaces.<br/>

When building applications we often deal with groups of things: a user's preferences, a customer's orders, 
or a product's color choices. To implement these groups of things in C#, we use collections. 
And to get the most from collections, we need to leverage generics. This course covers how, when, why, 
and best practices for using C# collections and generics, including arrays, generic interfaces, LINQ, delegates, 
and Lambda expressions.
